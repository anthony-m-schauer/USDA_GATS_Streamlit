# USDA GATS Streamlit App (Cloud Version)

This is a modified version of my USDA GATS data project, adapted specifically for deployment via **Streamlit Cloud**.

### 🚀 Purpose

This repo exists only to host the version of the app code that connects to a **cloud-based PostgreSQL database**, making it usable on Streamlit Cloud. It removes the local MySQL setup and updates the database connection logic accordingly.

### 📁 Structure

This version includes only the essential files needed to run the app:

- Updated database connector using `psycopg2`
- Cleaned and minimal Streamlit app code
- Requirements file for Streamlit to install dependencies

### 🔧 Notes

- This is **not the full project** — just the portion needed for cloud deployment.
- Code was lightly modified for compatibility but retains the same functionality.
- No local or sensitive files are included.
